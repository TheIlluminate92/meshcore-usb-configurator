# Project context

Windows desktop configurator for MeshCore Companion radios, initially a Heltec T114 nRF52840 on v1.17.1. Later bench validation should cover SenseCAP T1000-E magnetic USB. The original pre-upgrade export documents the working fleet configuration; the post-upgrade export is a comparison reference. Both remain local and do not authorize identity cloning or automatic restoration.

## Architecture

- `model.py`: supported settings, validation, unit conversion and JSON profiles. Browser radio units are converted to profile/protocol units.
- `device.py` and `serial_connection.py`: USB/BLE transport, reported settings, identity/stale checks, grouped-value preservation and reread verification.
- `app.py`, `batch_ui.py`, `batch_editor.py`: main editor, checkbox-based batch selection, shared settings, individual naming and reviewed sequential application.
- `profile_library.py`, `comparison.py`, `history_store.py`, `restart_check.py`: scoped JSON profiles, comparisons, local SQLite history and verification after user-confirmed restart.
- `app_paths.py`, `preferences.py`, `theme.py`: portable data location and appearance preferences. Packaged data stays in the adjacent hidden User Data folder; source runs use the project folder.
- `updater.py`, `update_ui.py`, release workflow: explicit GitHub release updates with anonymous public access, digest validation, retained previous EXE and deferred replacement.

## Boundaries

Use supported Companion protocol commands; never modify internal flash files. Enable only options justified by reported data and implemented protocol operations. Preserve unmodified grouped values and unknown fields. Batch names/positions are identity-bound individual overrides; a shared profile never clones device identity.

Read, edit, review, write, verify remain separate steps. Stop on batch write failure; no automatic retry, rollback or resumption of interrupted writes. A no-change plan is not a new verification. Restart confirmation is user supplied, not independently detected.

## Current handoff

Portable version 0.7.0 includes four equal-column settings pages, dark/light/system themes, checkbox batch selection, saved-profile application, comparison/history, naming defaults and update controls. User is testing the portable build; do not replace their running EXE or alter their data during documentation/maintenance work. The repository is now public; the updater uses anonymous GitHub release access.

The latest local validation is 116 passing tests, disposable Windows updater integration and packaged startup. Remaining hardware validation gaps are tracked in VALIDATION.md. CHANGELOG.md retains historical bug notes; historical test counts are not the current suite count.


0.6.0 adds identity-bound restore from individual apply reports, rotating sanitized diagnostics and GitHub-ready support ZIP export, compatibility inspection, and three built-in role presets. Repeater/Room Server presets are explicitly reference-only; only Companion wire operations exist. Do not mistake presets for firmware role conversion. The user confirmed the 0.5.3-to-0.5.4 update/restart works. No automatic support upload: the user attaches the ZIP and submits the GitHub issue.


0.7.0: firmware_role.py adds explicit read-only USB CLI role discovery with exact repeater/room_server replies; Companion is confirmed through its protocol, unknown stays unknown. No server writes. profile_library notes are user-owned and round-trip through library JSON. dry_run.py exports offline plans without channel secrets. portable_backup.py makes atomic verified backups with SQLite backup API and the packaged EXE. update_ui displays release bodies; release_notes.py builds them from CHANGELOG.md. COMMUNITY_REQUESTS.md records public forum/Reddit ideas only, not authorization to implement them.
